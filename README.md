## ðŸŽ¯ Tasks & Solutions

```sql
-- Task 1 â€“ Group orders by date
SELECT OrderDate
FROM Orders
GROUP BY OrderDate;

-- Task 2 â€“ Count orders per date
SELECT OrderDate, COUNT(OrderDate) AS OrderCount
FROM Orders
GROUP BY OrderDate;

-- Task 3 â€“ Total quantities by department
SELECT Department, SUM(OrderQty) AS TotalQuantity
FROM Orders
GROUP BY Department;

-- Task 4 â€“ Orders between 1st and 30th June 2022
-- Using WHERE before GROUP BY
SELECT OrderDate, COUNT(OrderID) AS OrdersCount
FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2022-06-01' AND '2022-06-30'
GROUP BY OrderDate;

-- Alternative: Using HAVING after GROUP BY
SELECT OrderDate, COUNT(OrderID) AS OrdersCount
FROM Orders
GROUP BY OrderDate
HAVING OrderDate BETWEEN '2022-06-01' AND '2022-06-30';
